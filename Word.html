        <h3>Belated Happy Birthday to the Kindest Boy!</h3>
        <p>
       
<p><b>Note:</b> To be honest, I wasn’t fully content with the cake I bought for you on your birthday. Gift-giving is literally <i>my love language</i>, and it honestly felt kuwang. Yeah, sure, nag gasto ko, but everything felt so rushed since I had to cram everything right after our Miting de Avance 😭. If I wasn’t drowning in campaign duties, <i>I definitely would’ve done so much more</i>. And don’t I always give you letters on every occasion? But on your birthday, of all days, I forgot. 💔 So, to make up for it, here I am, writing you one now.</p>

<p>And not just any letter <i>a very dramatic, overly heartfelt, and unnecessarily long one</i>. Because let’s be real, <b>it’s me</b>. Would you expect anything less? 🤷‍♀️</p>


<b>(Written on 3/30/25)</b>
<br>
<p><b>It has officially been 1 year, 4 months, and 12 days since November 18, 2023.</b> </p>

<p> We've been friends for quite a long time, huh? And honestly, I don't know what I did to deserve <i>a friend as lovely as you</i>. 🥰 Life has been so much more fun (<i>and a little more dramatic</i>) ever since <b>I met you</b>. A <i>gay friend</i> truly makes life ✨ <b>a masterpiece</b> ✨, and for that, I'll always be grateful. Though, I do have to admit <i>your mood swings</i> and your <i>bipolar disorder</i> can be a lot sometimes 😭, but even then, you're still <b>my best friend</b> through and through.</b></p>

<p>Chrysler, haven’t I always told you that you have <i>pretty eyes</i>? I mean it. And when I say you’re pretty, I’m not joking. <i>You are pretty</i>. 🥰 Sure, I always joke that you’re bald and pahak, and maybe I got karma for that, but your hair is what makes you unique. When I try to find you in a crowd, all I have to do is <b>search for those curls</b>.  Also, for me, you don’t smell bad at all. In fact, I think it’s pretty obvious that I find you humot. So please, stop asking if you’re baho. 😭And I know this sounds childish, but honestly, Chrysler, I feel like if we were born in another life, where you were a girl, I’m so sure we’d be besties there<3</p>

<p>Oh, and I’m sorry for always joking about your family. I promise to be more considerate in the future (totally 👀). Also, sorry if I always away you, side-eye you, or if I’m sometimes maldita towards you. I can’t help it. But jokes aside, I think it’s pretty obvious that despite all the mean things I do, deep inside, <b>I care about you the most</b>. Have I ever mentioned that, despite being a crybaby, I’ve been trying to learn how to hold back my tears in front of you? Not because I don’t want to cry, but because I always feel embarrassed about it🙃 Maybe it’s because you’re always too kind to me. I don’t even know how to explain it.</p>

<p>Looking back at everything, <i> I can’t help but wonder—why? Why are you always so kind? Why do you stay, even when I’m at my lowest? Why are you always there for me?</i>I remember you once said that you think people hate you. But why would anyone ever hate you? I mean, sure, people joke about you, and sometimes they even say harsh things but that doesn’t mean they actually hate you. you have your flaws, but hello? So does literally everyone else on this planet. But even with your own flaws, you’re still <i>one of the best people I know</i>.❤️.</p>


<p>As time passed, I realized that I value our friendship far more than any temporary, <i>silly feelings</i>. I wasn’t entirely sure about back then. But if there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s that I will <b>always</b> prioritize our friendship and sometimes, that means putting certain feelings <b>aside</b> ones <i>I don’t always understand or like</i>, feelings that should be <i>hidden</i> deep inside.

<p> Regarding what happened last week erm—ever since then, It made me felt the kind of heaviness that makes you want to curl up in a ball and disappear, It's literally so uwaw knowing that I might have disappointed someone I cherish so much? It’s an actual <b>nightmare.</b> I was such an idiot for even trying to argue with you that night, and guess what? In the end, I was the one who ended up crying (as expected, sorry ako na yan) And in real life? I thought I’d be brave enough to talk. I really did. But when the moment came, I couldn’t. I stayed quiet because I knew that the moment I spoke, I’d probably just end up crying👍</p>

<p> So here I am, doing the one thing I actually know how to do—making up for it in the way that makes the most sense to me. Through my love language. This is me, in the <i>most OA, dramatic, and hopelessly sincere way possible,</i> telling you that <b>I’m sorry.</b> I promise not to away you na! (99% sure)</p>
<br>
<br>
<block quote><i> "And if words could hug, I’d wrap you in the warmest one. If apologies could be felt, I’d make sure this one reaches your heart."</i></block quote>
<br>
<h4><b>💌 From the most bias president, top 2 most OA, dramatic side-eyeing, yet emotionally unstable but forever loyal human being, Mia.<b></h4>
 </p>
