        <h3>Belated Happy Birthday to the Kindest Boy!</h3>
        <p>
       
<p><b>Note:</b> To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt fully content with the cake I bought for you on your birthday. Gift-giving is literally <i>my love language</i>, and it honestly felt kuwang. Yeah, sure, nag gasto ko, but everything felt so rushed since I had to cram everything right after our Miting de Avance üò≠. If I wasn‚Äôt drowning in campaign duties, <i>I definitely would‚Äôve done so much more</i>. And don‚Äôt I always give you letters on every occasion? But on your birthday, of all days, I forgot. üíî So, to make up for it, here I am, writing you one now.</p>

<p>And not just any letter <i>a very dramatic, overly heartfelt, and unnecessarily long one</i>. Because let‚Äôs be real, <b>it‚Äôs me</b>. Would you expect anything less? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>


<b>(Written on 3/30/25)</b>
<br>
<p><b>It has officially been 1 year, 4 months, and 12 days since November 18, 2023.</b> </p>

<p> We've been friends for quite a long time, huh? And honestly, I don't know what I did to deserve <i>a friend as lovely as you</i>. ü•∞ Life has been so much more fun (<i>and a little more dramatic</i>) ever since <b>I met you</b>. A <i>gay friend</i> truly makes life ‚ú® <b>a masterpiece</b> ‚ú®, and for that, I'll always be grateful. Though, I do have to admit <i>your mood swings</i> and your <i>bipolar disorder</i> can be a lot sometimes üò≠, but even then, you're still <b>my best friend</b> through and through.</b></p>

<p>Chrysler, haven‚Äôt I always told you that you have <i>pretty eyes</i>? I mean it. And when I say you‚Äôre pretty, I‚Äôm not joking. <i>You are pretty</i>. ü•∞ Sure, I always joke that you‚Äôre bald and pahak, and maybe I got karma for that, but your hair is what makes you unique. When I try to find you in a crowd, all I have to do is <b>search for those curls</b>.  Also, for me, you don‚Äôt smell bad at all. In fact, I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that I find you humot. So please, stop asking if you‚Äôre baho. üò≠And I know this sounds childish, but honestly, Chrysler, I feel like if we were born in another life, where you were a girl, I‚Äôm so sure we‚Äôd be besties there<3</p>

<p>Oh, and I‚Äôm sorry for always joking about your family. I promise to be more considerate in the future (totally üëÄ). Also, sorry if I always away you, side-eye you, or if I‚Äôm sometimes maldita towards you. I can‚Äôt help it. But jokes aside, I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that despite all the mean things I do, deep inside, <b>I care about you the most</b>. Have I ever mentioned that, despite being a crybaby, I‚Äôve been trying to learn how to hold back my tears in front of you? Not because I don‚Äôt want to cry, but because I always feel embarrassed about itüôÉ Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre always too kind to me. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it.</p>

<p>Looking back at everything, <i> I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîwhy? Why are you always so kind? Why do you stay, even when I‚Äôm at my lowest? Why are you always there for me?</i>I remember you once said that you think people hate you. But why would anyone ever hate you? I mean, sure, people joke about you, and sometimes they even say harsh things but that doesn‚Äôt mean they actually hate you. you have your flaws, but hello? So does literally everyone else on this planet. But even with your own flaws, you‚Äôre still <i>one of the best people I know</i>.‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>


<p>As time passed, I realized that I value our friendship far more than any temporary, <i>silly feelings</i>. I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure about back then. But if there‚Äôs one thing I know for sure, it‚Äôs that I will <b>always</b> prioritize our friendship and sometimes, that means putting certain feelings <b>aside</b> ones <i>I don‚Äôt always understand or like</i>, feelings that should be <i>hidden</i> deep inside.

<p> Regarding what happened last week erm‚Äîever since then, It made me felt the kind of heaviness that makes you want to curl up in a ball and disappear, It's literally so uwaw knowing that I might have disappointed someone I cherish so much? It‚Äôs an actual <b>nightmare.</b> I was such an idiot for even trying to argue with you that night, and guess what? In the end, I was the one who ended up crying (as expected, sorry ako na yan) And in real life? I thought I‚Äôd be brave enough to talk. I really did. But when the moment came, I couldn‚Äôt. I stayed quiet because I knew that the moment I spoke, I‚Äôd probably just end up cryingüëç</p>

<p> So here I am, doing the one thing I actually know how to do‚Äîmaking up for it in the way that makes the most sense to me. Through my love language. This is me, in the <i>most OA, dramatic, and hopelessly sincere way possible,</i> telling you that <b>I‚Äôm sorry.</b> I promise not to away you na! (99% sure)</p>
<br>
<br>
<block quote><i> "And if words could hug, I‚Äôd wrap you in the warmest one. If apologies could be felt, I‚Äôd make sure this one reaches your heart."</i></block quote>
<br>
<h4><b>üíå From the most bias president, top 2 most OA, dramatic side-eyeing, yet emotionally unstable but forever loyal human being, Mia.<b></h4>
